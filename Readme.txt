This repository contains all files constituting the prototypes developed as part of the
master thesis: “Secure Dynamic Cloud-based Collaboration with Hierarchical Access”.

The entire master thesis is available from Aarhus University here:
http://eng.au.dk/fileadmin/DJF/ENG/PDF-filer/Tekniske_rapporter/TR_ECE_8_-_ver3.pdf

Source code is in the languages: C, C++, C# and the prototypes have been developed
using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 and integrates with on Microsoft Windows Azure.
To deploy the prototypes a new Windows Azure account must be created and configured,
however, the prototypes can also be used locally.

Included in this repository is the source code developed specifically for the prototypes
by the thesis authors, as well as libraries in which the prototypes depend.

These are:
-The JHU-MIT Proxy Re-cryptography Library (Both source code and binaries)
-The MIRACL library (Both source code and binaries)
-Log4net (Binaries only)

The Goals and features of the prototypes are described in chapter 6 of the master thesis.
Furthermore, the technicalities are briefly discussed in appendix B.
